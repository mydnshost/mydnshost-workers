# mydnshost-workers

This repo holds the code for the various job workers for mydnshost.

The Job Dispatcher (https://github.com/mydnshost/mydnshost-dispatcher) creates job events for us to run. Logs from these are then consumed by the job logger (https://github.com/mydnshost/mydnshost-joblogger)

## Running

This is probably not useful on it's own, see https://github.com/mydnshost/mydnshost-infra

## Comments, Questions, Bugs, Feature Requests etc.

Bugs and Feature Requests should be raised on the [issue tracker on github](https://github.com/shanemcc/mydnshost-joblogger/issues), and I'm happy to receive code pull requests via github.

I can be found idling on various different IRC Networks, but the best way to get in touch would be to message "Dataforce" on Quakenet (or chat in #Dataforce), or drop me a mail (email address is in my github profile)
